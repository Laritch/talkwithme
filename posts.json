Here are a few techniques I recommend to my clients:\n\n1. **Take short breaks**: Even 5 minutes away from your desk can help reset your mind\n2. **Practice deep breathing**: 4-7-8 technique works wonders (inhale for 4, hold for 7, exhale for 8)\n3. **Prioritize tasks**: Use the Eisenhower matrix to focus on what's important\n4. **Set boundaries**: Learn to say no when your plate is full\n5. **Stay hydrated and eat well**: Physical health impacts stress levels\n\nHope these help!
